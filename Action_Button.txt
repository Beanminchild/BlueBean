Above is an icloud link to the shortcut i use to interface with this program to unlock my laptop...
This is able to unlock the laptop  in less than a second  after activating the "Spectre Unlock" step in most cases.
The other steps are not needed just left over from other functionality that i also tie to my action button all you need 
is the logic under "Spectre Unlock"

Theres multiple ways to handle the shortcut but the way i have it seems to be the fastest and 
most reliable based on my many many hours of experimentation with this project.

If you find a better way to do it please let me know!
