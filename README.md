Bluetooth Proximity Unlock for Linux


 I use this along with a custom shortcut for my iPhones Action button to automatically unlock my laptop since linux doesnt support windows Hello

 ## How to Use

 This is not set up to use out of the box just puttting on github to keep the code safe and also to hopefully  provide an easier starting point for those who want to do something simillar.

 I provided my .service file as an example but you will need to look up how to set up a linux service for this to actually work. It is not quite as simple as copying the files in the right places.

 If you use this and make any improvments or add cool features please feel free to let me know, id love to see any cool things people try!
